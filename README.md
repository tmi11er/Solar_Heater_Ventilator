# Solar_Heater_Ventilator
pic16f18426 Embedded Solar Heater Ventilator Controller Software

The code is for a custom board with a pic16f18426 processor.  
When the code was uploaded the microchip xc8 compiler was not working correctly, so there are many extra lines of 
testing in the code that should not be there.
It worked for a while, but then it failed some instructions from the C code, including a comparison of a value in an if().
If it gets working persistantly it will be repaired and updated.
Perhaps in the future the board kicad files will be added, but some of the code should serve as good examples of some of 
the features of the processor.
